# qudi-lab-on-a-molecule-modules

This is a fork of [Ulm-IQO's qudi module](https://github.com/Ulm-IQO/qudi-iqo-modules) that we use at LENS to work on single molecule experiments.

We try to maintain it up to date with the original repository by rebasing our modifications on top of it. You can see a list of modifications in [the LENS changelog](docs/changelog-lens.md).
