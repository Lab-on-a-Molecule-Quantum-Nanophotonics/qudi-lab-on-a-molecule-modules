# Finite sampling io for scanning

Typically, our toptica laser is controlled by an analog tension generated by a national instrument card. We have an [interfuse]() to use this interface as an excitation scanner

## Finite sampling scanning excitation interfuse

This module is meant to be connected to a finite sampling io hardware for scanning and a `ProcessSetpointInterface` instance to set the laser's position during idling. Both are typically the same physical hardware underneath: the NI card.

This hardware uses a [state machine](../state-machines) that is depicted below. The link are clickable and lead to the specific method documentation for the state.
