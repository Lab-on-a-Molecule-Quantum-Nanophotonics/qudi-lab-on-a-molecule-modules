Qudi Lab on a Molecule Modules documentation
============================================

This is the documentation for the [Qudi](https://ulm-iqo.github.io/qudi-core/) modules used in our lab at [LENS](https://quantumnanophotonics-lab.ino.cnr.it/). It is based on [Ulm IQO's qudi modules](https://github.com/Ulm-IQO/qudi-iqo-modules/) and some of this documentation uses their documentation.

If you are new to Qudi, we recommend starting with [the crash course tutorial](<Crash course into Qudi>).
